{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Introduction\n\nFor my Capstone project I am trying to look at videogames sales and their relationship to countries and genres. The question I am wanting to explore in this project is if the popularity of video games has changed over time. More specifically, has the popularity changed not just by the number of individual purchases but by other metrics such as genre and location. These metrics are important because they can give insight into deeper questions for businesses to gain a competitive edge.\n\nSub-Population\n\nNorth American, Japan, European Union countries\n\nData Source\n\nThe data source I will use will be from kaggle.com titled ‘Video Game Sales and Ratings’. The link to the data is below: https://www.kaggle.com/kendallgillies/video-game-sales-and-ratings This dataset contains a list of game sales since january 2017. It focuses on sales with greater than 100,000 copies but also includes other interesting pieces of data such as critic and user ratings.\n\nResearch Design Hypothesis Ho: There Is Not Significant Difference Between video game sales with genres or countries Ha: There Is a Significant Difference Between video game sales with genres or countries\n\nMethodology Display heatmaps, barplots, box/violin plots to look for distribution patterns and correlations\n\nIf data does appear normal t-Testing on sales (Primary Variable) For all Sub-Populations If data does not appear normal than a Kruskal Wallis or Mann Whitney will have to be performed\n\nPurpose\n\nThe results of my analysis will be useful to stakeholders for different gaming platforms. It will give them insight into what geographical areas and genres they are successful in as well as new markets to tap into to increase profits.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import df and libraries\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom plotnine import *\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom scipy import stats","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#import df and get rid of null values and check header for first few values to make sure df was imported properly\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/video-game-sales-and-ratings/Video_Game_Sales_as_of_Jan_2017.csv')\ndata = data.dropna()\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#check all columns to understand what data I have to work with\ndata.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I have a lots of different columns to observe but I first need to know what unique values I am working with so that I can organize the data.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#I need to know lower limit of year since I know from kaggle that the upper limit is January 2017\ndata.Year_of_Release.min()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
